possible ways to redirect to a new page:
html:
 a href
 css: content("URL") inside of an anchor
JS:
 window.location & document.location    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.location
 http redirects

possible ways to refer to content:
css:
    url()
    relative paths from the css location
    relative path from the domain of the css
      this is problematic if the domain is different than the page one, since referer won't help and neither will a cookie solution
        only way is to parse
    full href
html:
    *[style="url()"]
    *[src] (eg:script)
    *[href] (eg:link)
JS:
    editing DOM https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/MutationObserver#MutationObserverInit
    editing CS (no clue how to observe this)
    AJAX http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest

Fallbacks:
    1. catch unresolved relative path request and with the help of referer, proxy them correctly.
    2. IFRAME: when the iframe goes to a link outside of the proxy, redirect it to the proxy


parsing css:
    url can take urls without quotes, but they must not have parenthesis
    if urls have quotes they must not have the same type of quote inside of them, eg: url("adsa/?="dasd"&ds") is invalid, but url('adsa/?="dasd"&ds') is perfectly valid
    semicolons are perfectly legal in urls http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1178024/can-a-url-contain-a-semi-colon

    minify css first to make parsing faster and to reduce the number of assumptions (eg. circumvent white space and comments)

    why not use a css parser?
    overkill, we only want to modify the URLS inside of url(URLS) and most css parsers don't parse the value of properties, bringing pretty much nothing new compared to a regex

RoadMap:
1.Deal with scalability issues (huge datasets)
2.security
    make sure document operations are properly authorized first (eg. clients don't have permission to read/write other runs)



bugs:
1. https to google failt with "..EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA:expecting an rsa key.."
  node.js bug: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/4771
2. when parsing with cheerio End of html document is missing
  Fix: remove content length from response header
3. when parsing with cheerio some websites are broken, eg: imdb movies
4. iOS6 does not work.
    the iFrame sometimes works sometimes doesn't.
    CLEAR PROBLEM: sharejs was halting the server due to the long polling bug
    Solution: Use websockets, see BUG 5.
5. WebSocket and SockJS not working
    Tried: changing to port 80
        Did nothing.
        Fix: https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-node/issues/78
        Also fixed websockets and Sockjs

Uneded bugs:
a. Couldn't make node work on port 80
    Did not work: Stopping Apache
    Running node as root
